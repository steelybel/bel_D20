# bel_D20 - Bel's Dungeons!

This is a game created by Bel for an assessment.

The language binding is maintained at [ChrisDill/Raylib-cs][raylib-cs] and
is compatible with Raylib 2.0. Work towards Raylib 2.5 can be tracked in
[this issue](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs/issues/22).

It is primarily intended for use by students in the Game Programming course at
the Seattle Campus of the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.

This is written against .NET Core 2.0 and primarily supports Windows.
Adjustments may be needed for other platforms.
